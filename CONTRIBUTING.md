Please help us with this project!
We need help in several areas. 

1. ** We need people to take the survey. ** 

This survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. 

Tips for participants: 
Write anything you think is noteworthy in the notes, and don't worry if you can't find the information - it may not exist!

Sometimes statements on issues like Executive Orders are easy to find, and sometimes they're buried. We are judging on the presence or absence of an official statement and that statement's content, rather than its location. Check official society social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Google search for terms on an official domain using site:society.com "search terms"

For example:
site:sfn.org "executive order" 

2. We need help to refine the survey itself

to collect data on the actions of (mostly American) scientific societies and professional organizations in the Trump era. We will ask for links to the statements made by your society throughout the survey. These links will help us better understand each society's position on the issues. We are hoping to have each society covered by multiple participants.
