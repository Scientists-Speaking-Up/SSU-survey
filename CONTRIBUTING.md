Please help us with this project!
We need help in several areas. 

### Phase I - Preparing to collect the data
1. **We need people to take the survey.** Taking the survey will help us see what kind of data the survey produces in its current form. Your feedback on your survey-taking experience will help us to improve the survey. 

This survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. We are hoping to have each society covered by multiple participants, so do not worry about duplications.

Tips for contributors taking the survey: 
Write anything you think is noteworthy in the notes, and don't worry if you can't find the information - it may not exist! Collect links when you can, these links will help us better understand each society's position on the issues. 

Sometimes statements on issues like Executive Orders are easy to find, and sometimes they're buried. We are judging on the presence or absence of an official statement and that statement's content, rather than its location. Check official society social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Google search for terms on an official domain using site:society.com "search terms"

For example:
site:sfn.org "executive order" 

2. **We need help to refine the survey itself** Do you have expereince in survey research? We are all scientists, but none of us have been trained in survey research. We would love to chat with you and get your feedback.
### Phase II - Collecting the data

1. **We will need help to publicize the survey to as broad a group as possible.**
2. **Please take the survey again when it is finished :)**

### Phase III - After the data is collected...
1. After the data is collected, we would like to **coordinate with active members of societies** to discuss the results to the societies and work with the members and societies to ensure that socities are standing up for their members' values, and create meaningful pathways to advocacy within scientific societies.
