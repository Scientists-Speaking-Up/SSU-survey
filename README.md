# SSU-survey
We are a group of scientists who are committed to a brighter future for science and society. There is much at stake: cuts to funding, denials of climate change, and the muzzling of scientists pose a serious threat to the scientific community, to democracy, and to the world more broadly. Furthermore, we are deeply concerned about the discriminatory policies and hateful language presented by the current administration targeting marginalized communities. The recent Executive Order on Immigration is unacceptable and poses a serious threat to the livelihood of refugees and immigrants. Under the current political circumstances, we believe it is imperative for scientists to speak up and urge their institutions and professional societies to do the same. 

We want to collect data on the response of scientific societies to the political climate. Please help us refine a survey to collect data on the actions of (mostly American) scientific societies and professional organizations in the Trump era. We will ask for links to the statements made by your society throughout the survey. These links will help us better understand each society's position on the issues. We are hoping to have each society covered by multiple participants.

The survey can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHJGxXuQRAzq4CHME07NOJFityl_gkuXpjZz4WGxfrKJ-zOg/viewform)

More details on contributing to this project can be found in CONTRIBUTING.md 

This survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. 

Tips for participants: 
Write anything you think is noteworthy in the notes, and don't worry if you can't find the information - it may not exist!

Sometimes statements on issues like Executive Orders are easy to find, and sometimes they're buried. We are judging on the presence or absence of an official statement and that statement's content, rather than its location. Check official society social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Google search for terms on an official domain using site:society.com "search terms"

For example:
site:sfn.org "executive order"
